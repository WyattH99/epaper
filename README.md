I am using this project as a way to implement "Environmental Modification" to help me achieve my goals.

To do this I will have a display on my wall that will have the status and key information of my goals.

Example:
    Goal:
        One of my current goals is to complete all 500 stars of Advent of Code by December 1st.
    Environmental Modification:
        Have a display that I walk past every day that says:
            - Current number of stars
            - How many days until December 1st
            - How many stars I have to do per day to achieve my goal
            - How many stars I did in the past week (or a calendar view of how many stars I did on each day)

The idea here is that if I'm reminded every day of the goal I am working towards and the momentum that I have built to get there, then I am more likely to achieve the goal.
